# iiectf1612-reverse2
Reverse2 of IIECTF December 2016

Notes: 
1. The project name during development is Reverse1.
2. This source code differs a little with the binary released in the match. That release has some small anti-debug bugs and spelling mistakes that do not affect the solution. Nevertheless, the code is still not perfect in some way.
3. I have written some comments to make it easier to read.
